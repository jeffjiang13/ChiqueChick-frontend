## About The Project
<p>ChiqueChick is a fully functional, feature-rich e-commerce platform meticulously crafted with a modern tech stack. Its design is inspired by the desire to create an intuitive and enjoyable online shopping experience that rivals that of industry leaders in e-commerce.

The application supports essential e-commerce functionalities such as user authentication, product browsing, cart operations, and secure online payments. It goes the extra mile by offering additional features like wishlist management, live product search, and order tracking, enabling users to have a comprehensive and fulfilling online shopping experience.

ChiqueChick is built using Next.js, a powerful React framework that enables server-side rendering and generates static websites for React-based web applications. The choice of Next.js greatly enhances the site's performance and SEO capabilities. TailwindCSS is used to achieve the platform's sleek, modern aesthetic, while MongoDB serves as the database solution, ensuring the application's scalability and flexibility.

Strapi, a headless CMS, is incorporated to offer a secure and flexible backend, making it easy to create, manage, and distribute content. To handle payments, the application integrates Stripe, one of the most trusted payment processing platforms.

The state management in the application is handled by Redux Toolkit, enabling easy access and control over the state throughout the application. The whole platform is then deployed on Vercel, ensuring a seamless user experience with its robust static and server rendering.

While this application currently operates in test mode, the platform can be easily transitioned for real-world use. ChiqueChick is a testament to how modern technology can facilitate a seamless, intuitive, and enjoyable e-commerce experience for users, pushing the boundaries of what is expected from online shopping platforms.</p>
